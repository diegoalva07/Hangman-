6. Descriptions of any Unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome

    - For some reason that i couldnt figure out and did not have time to go over, if nubmer of letter in the words from the array its different from 9, the letter counter gives an error. 
    - Wouldve like to add an animation of different hang man parts poping up everytime the player guesses a wrong letter, couldnt figure out how to do it and time was an issue
    - I think the code could be more DRY, I wanted to convert all functions to arrow fucntions but i was getting errors and did not have enough time to debug.
